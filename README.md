xDCIShare
============

xDCIShare is a collaborative website being developed for better access to data and models of scientific domains. xDCIShare is derived directly from the NSF-funded 3-clause BSD [HydroShare open source codebase](https://github.com/hydroshare/hydroshare), NSF awards [1148453](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1148453) and [1148090](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1148090). xDCIShare provides the sustainable technology infrastructure needed to address critical issues related to scientific research. xDCIShare expands data sharing capability by broadening the classes of data accommodated, expanding capability to include the sharing of models and model components, and taking advantage of emerging social media functionality to enhance information about and collaboration around scientific data and models.
